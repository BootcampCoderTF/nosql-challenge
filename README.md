# nosql-challenge
I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Used NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

## Part 2: Update the Database
Used NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

The magazine editors had some requested modifications for the database before I can perform any queries or analysis for them.

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Used NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

Eat Safe, Love had specific questions they wanted me to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.

Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
